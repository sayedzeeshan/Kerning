1. Install latest version of Python from the following link: https://www.python.org/downloads/
Got to customsetup and select PIP install from options as well as add python path to environment variables. This is required. See attached images for details.  
2. Create a folder to store glyphs/ligatures in C: or D: drive e.g. D:/Ligatures
3. Create the following folder structure and copy the glyph images to appropriate folder:
D:
  |_
    Ligatures
             |_
               Ligatures_Regular
             |_
               Haroof_Regular
	     |_
               Symbols
	     |_
               Ligatures_Kashida
             |_
               Haroof_Kashida
The last two folders are only required if you want to compile a Kashida font
Note that the names of the sub folders (Ligatures_Regular, etc.) have to be exactly the same as in this document.
4. Now run setup.bat and see if the module ligature_kerning is installed successfully. 
5. Open the settings.txt file in source/ folder and update the file according to your requirements. Details are provided at: https://github.com/sayedzeeshan/Kerning
6. Now run generate_VOLT_ouput.bat file and wait for the processing to complete (might take a few minutes to a few hours depending on the number of glyphs)
7. The outputs are copied to the base_dir (D:/Ligatures) in our example. 
8. You can change settings.txt again if the results are not satisfactory and run stage3.bat to get quick result (a few seconds). This is possible as the results of stage 1 and 2 are already stored on obj/ directory and need not be calculated for each iteration.
